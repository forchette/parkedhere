Simple Kotlin/Jetpack Composed-based WearOS (Android) application.
Purpose: quickly store a GPS location and navigate to it via Google Maps.

If you, like me, need something to remember where you park your car and quickly navigate to it, this is your app.

This app serves two distinct purposes:
- educational: this app allows me to experiment with Kotlin/Jetpack Compose on my WearOS smartwatch
- real aid: it gives me a fast way to get back to my car's parking directly from my smartwatch (no smartphone!)

## Install

Download the app code, open it in Android Studio, build and install it on your device (a real smartwatch or an emulated one).

## Usage

Open the app on your smartwatch.

Two buttons, nothing more, nothing less:
- "Set position": reads the current position ans stores it in memory (not written anywhere)
- "Navigate": opens Google Maps and sets it to navigate to the previously stored position
